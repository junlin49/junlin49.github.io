# Augument Reality : Review 1

## definition

> Azuma [3] provides a commonly accepted definition of AR as a technology which (1) combines real and virtual imagery, (2)  is interactive in real time, and (3) registers the virtual imagery with the real world.

## AR Research Topics

1. Graphics rendering hardware and software

   Graphics rendering hardware and software that can create the virtual content for overlaying the real world.

2. **Tracking techniques**

   Tracking techniques so that **the changes in the viewerâ€™s position can be properly reflected in the rendered graphics**

3. **Tracker calibration and registration tools**

   Tracker calibration and registration tools for **precisely aligning the real and virtual views when the user view is fixed**

4. Display hardware

   Display hardware for merging virtual images with views of the real world

5. Computer processing hardware for running AR simulation code and supporting input and output devices

6. Interaction techniques

   Interaction techniques specifying how the user can manipulate the AR virtual content.

## Tracking Techniques

### Sensor-Based Tracking Techniques

### Vision-Based Tracking Techniques

Vision-based tracking techniques can use image processing methods to **calculate the camera pose relative to real world objects.**

#### feature-based

The rationale underlying feature-based methods is to find a correspondence between 2D image features and their 3D world frame coordinates.

##### Markers

###### Artificial markers

Early computer vision papers at IWAR described marker tracking methods that could be used to calculate camera pose in real time from artificial markers.

###### Natural Features,such as points, lines, edges or textures

#### model-based



### hybrid tracking techniques
